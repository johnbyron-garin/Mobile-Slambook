## App Description: Using routes and passing data through the screen

## Things done in the code
- did the following:
    - routes
    - naming routes
    - passing data through the routes

## Challenges when developing the exercise
- I had a hard time figuring out how to pass the data through the screen, specifically the role of the "message" to the whole concept of passing of data through routes. I had to review the concepts and the function behind the newly introduced widgets to us.
